# AceCheck – Automated Golf Verification System
AceCheck is an automated, skill-based Hole-in-One challenge system designed for golf courses. 
Golfers scan a QR code on a par-3 hole, pay a small entry fee, hit their shot, and the system 
uses a green-side camera to verify whether they hit the green or made a Hole-in-One.

AceCheck provides:
- A **zero-cost, zero-admin new revenue stream** for golf courses  
- An **exciting skill challenge** for golfers  
- A fully automated backend linking **payments → camera triggers → secure video review**

## Core Features (MVP)
- **QR code activation** on the tee box  
- **Secure payment** (Stripe/Apple Pay/Google Pay)  
- **Camera health check** before enabling payment  
- **Automatic camera recording** (30-second clip)  
- **Admin review dashboard** for confirming refunds  
- **Cloud video storage (S3)** with timestamp verification
